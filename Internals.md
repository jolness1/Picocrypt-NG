# Internals
If you're wondering about how Picocrypt NG handles cryptography, you've come to the right place! This page contains the technical details about the cryptographic algorithms and parameters used, as well as how cryptographic values are stored in the header format.

# Core Cryptography
Picocrypt NG uses the following cryptographic primitives:
- XChaCha20 (cascaded with Serpent in counter mode for paranoid mode)
- Keyed-BLAKE2b for normal mode, HMAC-SHA3 for paranoid mode (256-bit key, 512-bit digest)
- HKDF-SHA3-256 for deriving subkeys from a single stream:
    - 64-byte subkey for header HMAC (v2)
    - 32-byte subkey for payload MAC (BLAKE2b or HMAC-SHA3)
    - 32-byte subkey for Serpent
    - Additional nonces/IVs during rekeying
- Argon2id:
    - Normal mode: 4 passes, 1 GiB memory, 4 threads
    - Paranoid mode: 8 passes, 1 GiB memory, 8 threads

All primitives used are from the well-known [golang.org/x/crypto](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto) module.

# Counter Overflow
Since XChaCha20 has a max message size of 256 GiB, Picocrypt NG will use the HKDF-SHA3 mentioned above to generate a new nonce for XChaCha20 and a new IV for Serpent if the total encrypted data is more than 60 GiB. While this threshold can be increased up to 256 GiB, Picocrypt NG uses 60 GiB to prevent any edge cases with blocks or the counter used by Serpent.

# Header Format
A Picocrypt NG volume's header is encoded with Reed-Solomon by default since it is, after all, the most important part of the entire file. An encoded value will take up three times the size of the unencoded value.

**All offsets and sizes below are in bytes.**
| Offset | Encoded size | Decoded size | Description
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | -----------
| 0      | 15           | 5            | Version number (ex. "v2.08")
| 15     | 15           | 5            | Length of comments, zero-padded to 5 bytes
| 30     | 3C           | C            | Comments with a length of C characters
| 30+3C  | 15           | 5            | Flags — see table below
| 45+3C  | 48           | 16           | Salt for Argon2
| 93+3C  | 96           | 32           | Salt for HKDF-SHA3
| 189+3C | 48           | 16           | IV for Serpent
| 237+3C | 72           | 24           | Nonce for XChaCha20
| 309+3C | 192          | 64           | HMAC-SHA3-512 of header (v2) or SHA3-512 of key (v1.x)
| 501+3C | 96           | 32           | SHA3-256 of keyfile key
| 597+3C | 192          | 64           | Authentication tag (BLAKE2b/HMAC-SHA3)
| 789+3C |              |              | Encrypted contents of input data

### Flags byte layout
| Byte index | Description
| ---------- | -----------
| flags[0]   | Paranoid mode (0=off, 1=on)
| flags[1]   | Keyfiles used (0=no, 1=yes)
| flags[2]   | Keyfile order matters (0=no, 1=yes)
| flags[3]   | **v2.08+**: RS parity encoding (0=disabled, 1=legacy sentinel for default 8-byte parity, 2–127=enabled with N parity bytes); **v2.07 and earlier**: boolean (0=disabled, 1=enabled with default 8-byte parity)
| flags[4]   | Final RS block was padded (0=no, 1=yes)

## Header Authentication (v2)
In v2.00+, the "key hash" field contains an HMAC-SHA3-512 computed over the following header fields (in order):
1. Version string
2. Comments length (5-char zero-padded string)
3. Comments content
4. Flags
5. Argon2 salt
6. HKDF salt
7. Serpent IV
8. XChaCha20 nonce
9. Keyfile hash

This provides integrity protection for the entire header, unlike v1.x which only stored SHA3-512(key). Picocrypt NG v2.00 maintains backward compatibility with v1.x volumes.

## Verify First Mode (Two-Pass Decryption)

Picocrypt NG offers an optional "Verify first" mode that addresses security audit recommendation PCC-004: authenticate ciphertext before decryption.

In standard streaming decryption, the MAC is computed incrementally alongside decryption, meaning the MAC can only be verified after the entire file has been decrypted. While Picocrypt uses encrypt-then-MAC (the correct order), this means the decryption algorithm is applied to potentially attacker-controlled data before authenticity is confirmed.

When "Verify first" is enabled, decryption proceeds in two passes:
1. **Pass 1 (Verification)**: Read entire file, compute MAC over ciphertext without decrypting
2. **MAC Check**: Verify computed MAC matches stored authentication tag
3. **Pass 2 (Decryption)**: Only if MAC is valid, perform actual decryption

**Trade-offs:**
- **Security**: Keys are never applied to unverified data
- **Performance**: File is read twice, roughly doubling I/O time
- **Recommended for**: High-security scenarios, untrusted file sources

This feature is available in the decrypt advanced options as "Verify first" checkbox.

# Keyfile Design
Picocrypt NG allows the use of keyfiles as an additional form of authentication. Picocrypt NG's unique "Require correct order" feature enforces the user to drop keyfiles into the window in the same order as they did when encrypting in order to decrypt the volume successfully. Here's how it works:

If correct order is not required, Picocrypt NG will take the SHA3-256 of each keyfile individually and XOR the hashes together. Finally, the result is XORed with the master key. Because the XOR operation is both commutative and associative, the order in which the keyfile hashes are XORed with each other doesn't matter - the end result is the same.

If correct order is required, Picocrypt NG will concatenate the keyfiles together in the order they were dropped into the window and take the SHA3-256 of the combined keyfiles. If the order is not correct, the keyfiles, when appended to each other, will result in a different file, and thus a different hash. So, the correct order of keyfiles is required to decrypt the volume successfully.

# Reed-Solomon
By default, all Picocrypt NG volume headers are encoded with Reed-Solomon to improve resiliency against bit rot. The header uses N+2N encoding, where N is the size of a particular header field such as the version number, and 2N is the number of parity bytes added. Using the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm, Picocrypt NG is able to automatically detect and correct up to 2N/2=N broken bytes.

If Reed-Solomon is to be used with the input data itself, the data will be encoded using 128+P encoding (where P is the number of parity bytes, default P=8, giving 128+8=136 bytes per block). The data is read in 1 MiB chunks and encoded in 128-byte blocks, with the final block padded to 128 bytes using PKCS#7.

As of **v2.08**, the parity setting is stored directly in `flags[3]` of the volume header, so decryption is entirely self-describing — there is no need to remember or re-supply the parity setting. The value `1` is reserved as a legacy sentinel meaning default parity (8 bytes), while custom parity values use 2 to 127, trading file-size overhead for greater corruption tolerance:

| Parity bytes (P) | Size overhead | Errors correctable per 128-byte block |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 8  (default)     | ~6%           | up to 4                                |
| 32               | 25%           | up to 16                               |
| 64               | 50%           | up to 32                               |
| 127              | ~99%          | up to 63                               |

The header MAC (HMAC-SHA3-512 stored in the key-hash field) covers `flags[3]`, so the parity value is cryptographically authenticated alongside all other header fields.

To address the edge case where the final 128-byte block happens to be padded so that it completes a full 1 MiB chunk, a flag is used to distinguish whether the last 128-byte block was padded originally or if it is just a full 128-byte block of data.

# Deniability
Plausible deniability in Picocrypt NG is achieved by simply re-encrypting the volume but without storing any identifiable header data. A new Argon2 salt and XChaCha20 nonce will be generated and stored in the deniable volume, but since both values are random, they don't reveal anything. A deniable volume will look something like this:
```
[argon2 salt][xchacha20 nonce][encrypted stream of bytes]
```

**Security Note:** The deniability layer intentionally uses unauthenticated encryption (XChaCha20 without a MAC). Adding authentication would defeat the purpose of deniability, as the MAC would be identifiable metadata. The inner volume remains fully authenticated, so data integrity is still protected.

# Security Considerations

## CLI Password Input

The CLI provides three methods for password input:

1. **Interactive (recommended)**: Omit `-p` and `-P` flags. The password is entered without echo and won't appear in shell history.
2. **Stdin (`-P`)**: For scripted use. Pipe password via stdin: `echo "pw" | picocrypt -P ...`
3. **Command-line (`-p`)**: **Warning**: The password will be visible in shell history, process listings (`ps`), and potentially system logs. Only use in environments where shell history is disabled or for testing.

For maximum security, prefer interactive prompts or stdin piping.

## Memory Handling

Picocrypt NG zeros sensitive key material after use via `crypto.SecureZero()`. This uses constant-time operations to prevent compiler optimization from removing the zeroing. However, Go's garbage collector may create copies of sensitive data that cannot be zeroed. This is an inherent limitation of garbage-collected languages. For most threat models, the implemented zeroing significantly reduces the attack window.
